# Pranav and Dora are playing a game in which Pranav will be saying 
# random numbers.Now Dora has to say Pranav the largest and smallest 
# numbers among these 10 numbers.Help Dora with your programing knowledge.
# Take 10 random inputs given by user and just print the largest and 
# smallest number on to the screen.

# i=0
# a=10
# b=[]
# while i<a:
#     n=int(input("Enter the number:-"))
#     b.append(n)
#     i+=1
# print(b)
# j=0
# max=0
# min=b[j]
# while j<len(b):
#     if b[j]>max:
#         max=b[j]
#     else:
#         min=b[j]
#     j+=1
# print("Maximum num is:",max)
# print("Minimum num is:",min)
    


# You are given a list of integer named num.Now prepare another list where
# every index in new list will contain the sum of elements from 0th to the index.
# a=[1,2,3,4,5]
# b=0
# c=[]
# i=0
# while i<len(a):
#     b+=a[i]
#     c.append(b)
#     i+=1
# print(c)

# Students of a class are standing in a row.
# The height of each students will be given in a list.
# Now every students wants to know how many other students in the class are taller than him.So, prepare another list of students with the required criteria.

# heights=[4,2,7,10,5,9,7,20,6]
# i=0

#         j+=1
#     c.append(count)
